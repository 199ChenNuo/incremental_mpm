overview
=======

**accompanying article**: [notes and examples for the material point method](https://nialltl.neocities.org/articles/mpm_guide.html)

this is an MIT-licensed commented implementation of the MLS-MPM algorithm for simulating soft bodies and fluids. 

all examples are single-file and self-contained. this package contains 3 scenes:

* a stripped-back example demonstrating how particle-grid transfers work in MLS-MPM

* non-linear elasticity using a Neo-Hookean model

* liquid simulation using a constitutive model for isotropic newtonian fluids

if you have any questions, they might be answered by [the article](https://nialltl.neocities.org/articles/mpm_guide.html), but if not feel free to contact me [@nialltl](https://twitter.com/nialltl) :o)

**Unity version:** 2018.3.10f1 â€” Untested in other versions.
